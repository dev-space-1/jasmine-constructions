Client: Mr. T.T.S. Dahanayake
Location: Marawila
Completion: 2017

This contemporary residence in Marawila reflects a harmonious blend of modern design principles and contextual materiality. The two-storey home features a striking red brick façade that anchors the central vertical volume, contrasting with clean white rendered walls. A unique highlight of the project is the use of vibrant stained-glass windows, which bring in filtered natural light and colorful reflections, particularly along the staircase. With a tiled gable roof, timber-framed fenestration, and carefully integrated balconies, the house balances functionality with visual warmth—creating an inviting and character-rich domestic environment
